# Contributing to Moodle on Azure 

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Our goal is to
work on Azure specific tooling for deploying and managing the open
source [Moodle](http://moodle.org) learning management system on
Azure. We do not work on Moodle itself here, instead we work upstream
as appropriate.

The short version of how to contribute to this project is "just do
it". Where "it" can be defined as any valuable contribution (and to be
clear, asking questions is a valuable contribution):

  * ask questions
  * provide feedback
  * write or update documentation
  * help new users
  * recommend the project to others
  * test the code and report bugs
  * fix bugs and issue pull requests
  * give us feedback on required features
  * write and update the software
  * create artwork
  * translate to different languages
  * anything you can see that needs doing

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do,
grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine
whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately
(e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the
bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our
CLA.

# Planning

This is an open source project. We have a few mantras to ensure
efficient collaboration, these mostly boil down to ensuring good
visibility into the communities goals. These include:

  * If it didn't happen in public, it didn't happen
  * Scratch your own itch
  
## If it didn't happen in public, it didn't happen (aka full transparency)

The goal of this mantra is to ensure maximum visibility into our
communities work in order to:

  1. Provide an opportunity for community feedback in order to ensure
     our plans are good
  2. Provide a clear indication of what will be done, what may be done
     and what won't be done
  
Both of these goals lead to the second mantra "Scratch your own itch".

## Scratch your own itch (aka getting what you want)

This is an open source project. We welcome feature requests and, as a
community, we will provide feedback on whether we intend to work on it
or not. To this end we categories feature requests in one of 4 ways:

  * Priority 0 (will address)
  * Priority 1 (may address)
  * Priority 2 (maybe one day)
  * wontfix (out of scope)

Using these priorities it is easy for community members to decide
where to spend their time. For example:

  * Priority 0 items are actively being worked on by at least one
    community member. Others are welcome to contribute as appropriate
    (reviews are particularly important)
  * Priority 1 items are seen as important and are likely to be worked
    on in the short to medium term, but there is no community member
    active on the project at this time. Community members are welcome
    to take ownership of these issues and propose a solution that they
    intend to implement. If the community accepts the proposal then it
    will become a Priority 0 issue.
  * Priority 2 items are seen as interesting proposals that are not in
    conflict with the projects goals but are unlikely to be worked on
    by any existing communty members. Community members who have a
    need for these items are strongly encouraged to identify
    themselves and offer a proposal for a solution. If there is enough
    support within the existing community this item can become a
    Priority 0 under your leadership.
  * Wontfix items are considered out of scope for this project.
    Community members should seek to solve the problem in different
    ways. Often this will mean contribution to Moodle itself or a
    plugin that is external to this community.
